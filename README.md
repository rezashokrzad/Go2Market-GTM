# Go2Market-GTM
Go2Market (GTM) and one of its subset Rout2Market(RTM) are two modern strategies in marketing for making businesses more lucrative. 

GTM works based on data (especially census data that is collected by market research). GTM strategy is a step-by-step plan created to successfully launch a product to market. This strategy is demand-based that helps manufacturers to generate an idea to produce goods according to data. I was engaged in designing and even implementing this project for Solico Group in Iran.

The most important part of this project was clustering customers (to 12 categories) based on both internal and census data.
