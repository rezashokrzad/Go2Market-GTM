Go2Market (GTM) and one of its subsets,  Rout2Market(RTM), are two modern data-driven strategies in marketing for making businesses more lucrative.

* GTM works based on data (especially census data that) which is collected by market research. 
* GTM strategy is a step-by-step plan created to successfully launch a product to the market. 
* This strategy is demand-based which helps manufacturers to generate an idea in order to produce goods according to data. 
* I was engaged in designing and implementing this project for Solico Group in Iran.
* The most important part of this project was clustering customers (in 12 categories) based on both internal and census data.
